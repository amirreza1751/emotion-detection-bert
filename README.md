# emotion-detection-bert
<h3>A bert based model to predict emotions from text inputs.</h3>

<p>In this project, we explore the application of text mining methodologies
to predict emotional profiles from text inputs. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained BERT model combined with regression techniques to predict the valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions of emotions.</p>
